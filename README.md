 Tool Checker

This is a comparison tool to check the prices of various fittings, tools, etc from builders merchants/tool suppliers such as toolstation, screwfix etc.

# Current Problem

I want to compare fittings & tools of several websites to find the lowest price. The only website that currently does this is [PriceSpy](https://pricespy.co.uk/). But it has some limitations; It doesnt allow you to compare multiple items for example - you pick a selection of items then it compares the prices. IN addition, it doesnt show you the cheapest because it is missing several more builder orentated businesses such a builders merchants. 

For example, I need some 'Push Fit Elbow 10mm' to do some electrics in a new build.

## Development Status

The initial commit consists of a golang api container that inserts a generic document into a mongodb container.
